## Description

This browser base web application uses the 5 day weather API provided by OpenWeatherMap to check the current weather for a particular city that the users inputs, as well as the forecast for the following 5 days in that city. 

The application was created using HTML and CSS but it mainly uses JavaScript for its functionality.

## The Weather App works in the following way:

# 1. The user types in the name of a city they want to search the weather for:

# 2. Once the user inputs the city that they want to search for they will be presented with the current weather data which will include the current date, tempreture, wind and humidity along with an icon forecasting the weather that day:

# 3. The user will also be presented with the weather data for the next five days.

# 4. Lastly when the user comes back to the page in the future they will have a list of cities they have already searched for in the past.

I hope this weather app will come in handy next time you need to plan your day.
